    zidio: `Collaborated in a team of 5 developers to create a location tracking app. 
    I had the task to create the app's API endpoints to be consumed by the client app.
    It was a great experience as I got to sharpen my server-side skills and concepts such as working with document database, MongoDB, API authentication, data modelling, writing high-quality code and deploying applications to production environments
